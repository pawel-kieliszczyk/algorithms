# Algorithms and data structures


## Overview

C++ library of algorithms and data structures focused on easy use and very high performance. Might be useful in algorithmic competitions such as TopCoder or Sphere Online Judge. This is a header only library compatible with C++03 standard.


## Continuous integration status

## Performance

The library focuses on high performance both minimizing computational complexity of all algorithms and maximizing possibility of efficient CPU caching. All data structures have fixed but custom maximum capacity and perform no memory reallocations once constructed.
